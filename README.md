# mndly.

### Opinionated by Design.

mndly is a collection of functional, focused, and minimalist web experiences. We strip away the noise to build digital products that actually matter. No clutter, no fluff—just intent.

## The Stack

- **Core:** Pure HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Grid/Flexbox)
- **Design:** Inter & System Sans-Serif, Grainy Gradients, Glassmorphism
- **Motion:** Intersection Observer API for reveal animations
- **Philosophy:** "Anti-social, Anti-productive, Pro-focus."

## Current Output

| Project        | Status       | Description                                    |
| :------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **rem**        | `Beta`       | A tool to be anti-productive and regain focus. |
| **mndly shop** | `Live`       | High-quality physical essentials.              |
| **Echo**       | `Foundation` | A minimalist communication layer.              |

## Design Principles

1. **Lowercase by Default:** We value the lack of pretense in lowercase typography.
2. **Asymmetry:** Grid layouts that breathe and force the eye to move.
3. **Monochrome + Contrast:** High-contrast interfaces (Pure Black `#0a0a0a`) with dimmed secondary information.
4. **Motion with Purpose:** Transitions are used to guide the user, not to distract them.

## Local Development
